# Welcome to Azure IoT Edge on Data Science Virtual Machine

This tool is an extension to the [Microsoft Azure Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)](http://aka.ms/dsvm) to add the Azure IoT Edge capability to bring the power of advanced analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to the edge. The Azure IoT Edge run time will be layered on top of the [Ubuntu edition of the DSVM](http://aka.ms/dsvm/ubuntu),  combining the rich AI and Machine Learning toolset on the DSVM with the capabilities to build applications for the intelligent edge.
