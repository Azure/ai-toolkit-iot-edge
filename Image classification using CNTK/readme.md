# IoT Scenario: Image Classification using Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)

This sample uses the popular [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) machine learning library from Google to classify the ageless [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) of handwritten digits. The project has been specifically designed to run with the Azure Machine Learning Workbench.
