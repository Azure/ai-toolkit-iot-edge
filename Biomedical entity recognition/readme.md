# IoT Scenario - Biomedical Entity Extraction

Biomedical named entity recognition is a critical step for complex biomedical NLP tasks such as:
Extraction of diseases, symptoms from electronic medical or health records, drug discovery, understanding the interactions between different entity types such as drug-drug interaction, drug-disease relationship and gene-protein relationship.

Our scenario focuses on how a large amount of unstructured and unlabeled data such as PubMed article abstracts can be analyzed to train a domain-specific word embedding model. Then the output embeddings are used as automatically generated features to train a neural entity extraction model. The sample uses Keras with TensorFlow deep learning framework as a backend.
